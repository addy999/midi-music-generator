# MIDI Music Generator

An AI music generator that creates MIDI compositions from text prompts using LLMS.

## Motivation

Instead of text-to-music models, I wanted to experiment with LLMS generating music, and the MIDI format is perfect for this.

- 🎵 Generate MIDI music from natural language descriptions
- 🔄 Loop mode for seamless repeating tracks
- 🎹 Supports all General MIDI instruments (0-127)
- 🎼 Multi-track compositions
- 🔊 MIDI to WAV conversion with FluidSynth
- 🤖 Works with multiple LLM providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)

## Setup

### Local Development

```bash
docker build -t midi .
docker run -p 5001:5001 midi
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5001`

## Usage

1. Enter your API key in the settings
2. Describe the music you want (e.g., "upbeat jazz with piano and drums")
3. Click "Generate" to create your MIDI file
